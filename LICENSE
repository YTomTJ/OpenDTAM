From the code:
"// Free for non-commercial, non-military, and non-critical
// use unless incorporated in OpenCV.
// Inherits OpenCV Licence if in OpenCV."

As of Sept. 23, 2016, the denoising core is pulled into OpenCV, so you can consider any of 
the DepthMapDenoiseWeightedHuber directory and the CostVolume directory to be BSD.

The Track folder and root were not pulled into OpenCV, so they are effectively CC BY-NC with military use excluded.

There seems to be some confusion on the non-military part: By that I mean that it cannot be used by 
the military (From Wikipedia: "The military are forces authorized to use deadly force, 
and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens.") and cannot be used for military 
purposes (ex. mercenaries, contractors developing weapons, logistical support for drones, etc.). 

In short if you build it into a product, ask yourself:
1."Am I or my employer part of the military?"
2."Is the primary user of this product or the things that it makes expected to be military?"
3."Will this product enable the deliberate killing of people?"
If you answer no to all of those, your use is not military.
